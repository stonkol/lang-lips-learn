// Go, also known as Golang due to its domain name (golang.org),
// is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed
// at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. 
// It was officially announced in November 2009 and has since 
// gained popularity for its simplicity, efficiency, and strong 
// support for concurrent programming.
//
// Is more simple to deploy a compiled server program ->
//    Because there are no runtime language dependancies
//
// Static typed get errors more quicky
//
